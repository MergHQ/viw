***OBJ viewer written in Java***

[Coursework for Joululabra2016](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/courses/582221/2016/s/a/3)

### How to use

Run the jar with `java -jar viw-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
The application will open a dialogue to open a .obj file. Select one and open it. You'll find some 3D models in `viw/models`.
The OBJ file should now appear on the screen. **Keep in mind that this application only supports triangular faces.**

By moving the mouse to left and right you move the camera around the 3D model. You can use the scroll wheel to adjust the distance to the 3D model.
